# ROM Organizer Script

This script is designed to help you organize your SNES ROM collection by categorizing them into folders based on genre, publisher, or alphabetical order. It uses the IGDB API to fetch game information and allows you to customize genre mappings. Additionally, it includes a cleanup feature to remove empty folders after reorganization.

## Features

### Generate CSV Database
- Fetches game information (genre, publisher) from the IGDB API.
- Creates a `roms_database.csv` file in your ROMs folder.

### Reorganize ROMs
- Moves ROMs into folders based on:
     - **Genre**
     - **Publisher**
     - **Alphabetical order** (first letter of the ROM name).

### Clean Up Empty Folders
- Deletes all empty folders in the ROMs directory after reorganization.

### Colored Console Output
- Uses colored text for better readability:
     - **Success messages**: Green
     - **Error messages**: Red
     - **Prompts**: Cyan
     - **Menu options**: Yellow

### Custom Genre Mapping
- Allows you to map IGDB genre names to custom, user-friendly names.

## Notes

- **API Rate Limit**: IGDB has a limit of 4 requests per second. The script includes a delay to comply with this limit.
- **Custom Genre Mapping**: You can modify the `genre_mapping` dictionary in the script to customize genre names.
- **Empty Folder Cleanup**: The cleanup feature only deletes empty folders. Folders with files are left untouched.
